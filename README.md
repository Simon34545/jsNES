NOTE: All versions except for the most recent versions (in the 'nes' folder) rely on scripts that put the contents of a rom in an array, which is then added to a object in roms.js
I can't include these scripts here, so you will need to add these yourself, or modify the cartridges contstructor to take a array of bytes and supply it yourself

In the most recent version, where I stop following javidx9's tutorial and start adding my own stuff, you can upload roms yourself and they get saved in the browsers local storage.
